# Project management system on Salesforce platform

# Introduction

In the modern era of information technology development, project management in the IT sector is becoming increasingly significant. Organizing effective time monitoring for task execution is one of the key aspects of success for companies specializing in IT services. This is especially important for businesses working under contracts where service costs are determined based on the time spent on projects.

This study analyzes the subject domain, outlines the system architecture, defines the requirements, describes key use cases, presents the designed data model, implements the system, and explores possible system scalability options.

The relevance of the research is driven by the rapidly changing business environment, where IT companies must continuously adapt to new challenges and requirements. In today’s competitive service market, efficient management of resources and processes is critical for the success of enterprises.

In particular, automating time tracking, absence management, and analytics helps reduce administrative overhead, improve service quality, and increase customer satisfaction. Integrating various business processes into a single information system reduces the risk of errors, enhances operational transparency, and supports more effective decision-making.

Therefore, developing an information system on the Salesforce platform that accounts for the specific needs of IT company management is highly relevant and necessary in today’s business landscape.

# Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop an information system for managing IT projects and company processes based on the Salesforce platform. The system aims to automate time tracking and other internal activities to increase personnel management efficiency and improve client interaction quality.

### Key objectives

- Time tracking optimization: The system enables logging time spent on project tasks and automatically generates reports, which can be used to create invoices for clients. This helps reduce financial calculation errors and increases transparency.

- Absence management automation: The system simplifies the submission of leave, sick leave, and other non-project-related absence requests, adding flexibility to internal processes.

- Improved analytics and reporting: The system allows for company-wide reporting and monitoring of each employee’s performance, helping leadership analyze productivity and make informed management decisions.

- Integrated management approach: The system combines project management, financial accounting, and internal processes into a single platform, improving company coordination and competitiveness.

- Ultimately, the project aims to increase the efficiency and flexibility of an IT company’s operations through a comprehensive information system that covers both project and internal business processes.

# Research Tasks

Study the specifics of IT company management, identify key processes and challenges, assess project management methodologies, and analyze the Salesforce platform's limitations and capabilities in the context of project management system development.

Design a data model and define system requirements, including core entities, their relationships, functional and non-functional requirements, and key user scenarios.

Implement the information system based on the defined requirements and objectives.

Analyze system scalability prospects and outline possible development paths, including architectural, integration, and infrastructure considerations.

# Object and Subject of Research

- Object: Modern information systems for managing projects and resources, particularly their impact on business process efficiency, time tracking automation, and personnel management.

- Subject: Architectural, functional, and technological aspects of implementing a time and absence management system based on the Salesforce platform, including its limitations, capabilities, and optimization for modern company needs.

# Research Methods

This research employed a comprehensive set of scientific methods, including abstract-logical modeling, systems analysis, and critical literature review, to thoroughly study the problem.

# Practical Significance

Resource management optimization: The developed system will allow IT companies to manage time and absences more efficiently, leading to better resource usage and increased productivity.

Improved decision-making processes: Detailed analytics on time usage and employee performance will enable timely and well-founded decisions regarding project and personnel management.

Reduced financial calculation errors: Automating time tracking and invoice report generation minimizes the risk of mistakes and inaccuracies in financial operations.

Increased employee satisfaction: A system for convenient leave/sick leave requests and feedback on performance will contribute to higher employee satisfaction.

Improved customer service: Transparency in project execution and time tracking will strengthen client trust and foster long-term relationships.

In conclusion, the development and implementation of this information system will significantly enhance company efficiency, improve project management, and ensure high-quality customer service.
